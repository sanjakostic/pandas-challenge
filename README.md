# pandas-challenge

This Python code is performing an analysis of school and student data to generate key metrics and insights about district and school performance. Using the pandas library, the code begins by loading school and student data from CSV files and merging them into a comprehensive dataset - `school_data_complete`. The district summary section calculates total schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects. The school summary section further breaks down the data by school, providing details such as school type, total students, total budget, per student budget, and average scores, along with the percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects. Some issues I ran into were regarding going back and forth between the column types (whether they were a pandas.series type or a pandas.dataframe type).

The highest and lowest performing schools are identified based on overall passing rates, and the code proceeds to analyze math and reading scores by grade. Additionally, it categorizes schools based on spending per student and school size, calculating averages for various performance metrics in each category. Finally, it groups schools by type (charter or district) and calculates average scores and passing rates. The results are presented in tabular format for easy interpretation and comparison.
